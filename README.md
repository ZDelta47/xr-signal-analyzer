# XR Signal Analyzer

A hardware + firmware project to capture, visualize, and analyze IMU sensor signals for XR devices (like AR glasses, headsets, and wearable controllers). Designed to assist with debugging instability and drift in 3DOF/6DOF experiences, and to accelerate development of custom XR input systems.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Build a portable IMU signal analyzer to observe real-time orientation/motion data
- Reverse-engineer sensor behavior in AR/VR/XR glasses
- Understand and simulate signal filtering/stabilization pipelines
- Develop skills in PCB design, embedded firmware, and signal processing

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- IMU sensor capture (accel + gyro)
- Signal plotting and logging
- Optional filtering and stabilization model
- Optional Octave-based simulation
